# Prosthetic-Arm
It involves the concept of Prosthetics which can be applied to other fields too. The
basic components of the hand and glove are the hand itself, the servos, the Arduino, the
glove,the Bluetooth modules and the flex sensors. The glove is mounted with flex sensors:
variable resistors that change their resistance value when bent. Theyâ€™re attached to one
side of a voltage divider with resistors of a constant value on the other side. The Arduino
reads the voltage change when the sensors are bent and triggers the servos to move a pro-
portional amount. The servos pull strings that act as tendons, allowing the fingers to move.
